Hello!
As a Master's student in Business Analytics and Information Management at the esteemed Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, I am honing my technical skills and business acumen while gaining invaluable industry exposure. My passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights has driven me to seek opportunities in the fields of Business Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Science.

My expertise in statistical tools and Data Visualization (Tableau), coupled with my proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, enables me to translate complex data into actionable insights. My academic projects have provided me with hands-on experience and the ability to deliver measurable results.

I thrive on learning and welcome conversations with individuals from different walks of life. So, please feel free to connect with me @ knemili@purdue.edu to discuss opportunities, share insights, or explore potential collaborations.
